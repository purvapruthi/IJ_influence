Code to generate figures is mainly in two ipython notebooks
1. Hessian_approximation_k_leave_out.ipynb - To calculate and compare hessian inverse using Newton-CG and Lissa method.
2. Perturbation_k_leave_out.ipynb - Generate multi-point perturbations using adverserial attack.

Both of above ipython notebooks generate plots using pre-saved data which will be too big to upload. 
Sample inputs can be generated usig provided notebooks. These notebooks import following python files.

1. LogReg.py - Logistic Regression Model
2. hessian.py - Calculates hessian using Newton-CG
3. experiments.py - Calculates hessian using Lissa
4. influence.py - Calculates influence for different re-weightings 1-leave-ou/K-leave-out/adverserial
5. util.py - Utility functions to split data
